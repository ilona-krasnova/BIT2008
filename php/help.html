                <p>
                    You can browse our catalogue or use the search feature to find seeds you like.
                    Once you find a seed you like, send a request to the user who posted the seed.
                    You must pick a seed you have listed to swap with the seed you are requesting.
                    If they accept your request, you will exchange your seed for their seed (swap),
                    and contact info will be shared and a chat feature will become available to finalize
                    the swap.

                <p class="transition hidden">
                    There are three lifecycles, annual, biennual and perennial. Annual plants only last one season,
                    they will die after that. Biennual plants will live for 2 years, then they will die. Perennials
                    come back every year, and will live for many years.
